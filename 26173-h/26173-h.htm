<h2 class="title"><small>A Genealogy of the Descendants of Joshua Stevens</small></h2>

<h4 class="hr3"><small>Written by Bascom Asbury Cecil Stephens, Los Angeles, California, A. D. 1892</small></h4>

<h4 class="hr4"><small>Printed, with a few additions, by Alonzo Smith Bower, Lima, Ohio, A. D. 1910</small></h4>

<p>JOSHUA STEPHENS, (6), the ancestor of this STEPHENS Family, was born,
according to the family tradition, in what is now the County of Berkes, in the
State of Pennsylvania, of Welsh parents, A. D. 1733. According to the
recollection of C. C. Stephens, (176) his grandfather, E. D. Stephens, (16), son
of this Joshua Stephens, (6), stated to him in an interview at Hardin, Ohio,
about 1860, that Joshua Stephens's father's name was also Joshua Stephens, (3),
which would make him the senior; that Joshua Stephens, Senior, with two
brothers, David, (5), and Ebenezer, (4), came over from Wales. Of these three
last named persons nothing further is known at the present writing, than the
foregoing statement.</p>

<p>That there was a large Welsh immigration into the present territory of Berkes
County prior to 1733, the birth year of Joshua Stephens, Jr., (6), is a fact
well corroborated by the (Stot.) history of Pennsylvania.</p>

<h2><a name="EXPLANATION" id="EXPLANATION"></a>EXPLANATION</h2>


<p>The principal abbreviations used in these pages are:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 1.5em;">b. standing for born.<br />
m. standing for married.<br />
d. standing for died.<br />
y. standing for young.</p>

<p>For convenience and distinction, as in all genealogical works, each name is
given a number separately. Without this it would be difficult to tell which
Joshua Stephens is meant, for there are many of that name, as also others. The
numbers are also valuable for tracing out any particular pedigree; for instance,
suppose that William Stephens, of Camp Verde, should desire to know the full
line of his paternal ancestry, he would find his name on page (41) 56, where his
number is given as 275: then looking up the left-hand column of figures he will
find No. 275 on page (21) 27, where he will find the date of his birth, and that
his father is Samuel Stephens, No. 76; thence, running up the column to No. 76,
which he will find on page (11) 12, he will find that Samuel was the son of
Charles Stephens, No. 19; the latter figure is found on page (8) 8, where
Charles is shown to be the son of David Stephens, No. 10; the last figure is to
be found on page (7) 7, showing that David was the son of Joshua Stephens, No.
6; he is the son of Joshua Stephens, No. 3. His pedigree is:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Joshua Stephens, (3), father of<br />
Joshua Stephens, (6), father of<br />
David Stephens, (10), father of<br />
Charles Stephens, (19), father of<br />
Samuel Stephens, (76), father of<br />
Williams Stephens, (275), father of</p>

<p>The name STEPHENS is of Greek derivation, and means a &quot;crown&quot;. Just how it
came to be adopted by the ancester of this family is unknown. The Welsh seldom
used surnames at that period, one name usually sufficing; the son taking his
father's name with the Welsh suffix &quot;AP,&quot; meaning &quot;son of&quot;; thus STEPHENS AP
EVANS, meaning Stephens the son of Evans, while the latter would be Evans Ap
somebody else. W. H. Stephens, (41), son of the aforesaid E. D. Stephens, (16),
once told the writer that the old family name was STEPHENSHIP. In a conversation
between the writer, (182), and Rev. M. A. Jordan, a stepson of Col. John
Stephens, (15), a brother of E. D. Stephens, (16), Mr. Jordan said that,
according to his information, the original family name was STEPHENS O'BIVENS.
Mr. Gilbert Cope, an eminent genealogist, living at West Chester, Pennsylvania,
clears these discrepancies by stating that the name was STEPHENS AP EVANS; that
is, Stephens the son of Evans. It is thus easy to see how easily one confused it
into Stephenship, and the other into Stephens O'Bivens. Accordingly, it must be
true that Joshua Stephens, Senior, (3), and perhaps his brothers, David, (5),
and Ebenezer, (4), adopted the permanent surname of Stephens. In fact, a family
tradition is that the emigrant ancester did adopt this name of Stephens. The
father of Joshua Stephens, Sr., (3), who, it is supposed, remained in Wales, may
have been named Stephens, (2), and his father's name may have been Evans, (1);
indeed, this theory is reasonable both from tradition and the etymology as given
in the foregoing. EVANS is a Welsh form of JOHN, a Greek word of Hebrew
derivation, meaning &quot;the grace of God.&quot;</p>

<p>This tradition is further strengthened by another: that the immigrant
ancestors of the family, sometime after their arrival in Pennsylvania, fell heir
to their father's estate in Wales. In court they were required to give
additional evidence as to their identity by reason of their having changed their
names, before their shares of the estate were distributed to them. Through these
official channels should be found the missing links, which will connect the
American Lines with the Welsh, and extend the genealogical tree across the
Atlantic Ocean. By these means only can the family seat, ancestry, arms and name
be discovered, for the item of the estate witnesses the fact that it was of no
&quot;common origin.&quot;</p>

<p>The indifference of the Welsh in the use of surnames is well shown by the
transcript of some documents of an estate of an old Stephens in Pennsylvania, in
the possession of the writer, wherein two brothers are named, one &quot;Evans
Stephens&quot; and the other &quot;Stephens Evans.&quot;</p>

<p>Searches in the offices of the Register of Wills, and the old Probate Courts
of Pennsylvania, and the Doctors' Commons and the Herold's College, of London,
as well as of the files of old Pennsylvania newspapers, and the archives of the
various historical societies of Pennsylvania should throw more light on the
early history of these immigrant ancesters, and possibly discover collateral
branches which are now seemingly hopelessly lost. Such searches require the
expenditure of more time and money than the writer now (1892) has, and if never
done by him, it is to be hoped that some family historian will come to the front
with the necessary abilities.</p>

<p>The family history, then, really begins thus:</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="FIRST_GENERATION" id="FIRST_GENERATION"></a>FIRST GENERATION</h2>


<p class="i3">&#8194;&#8194;1. EVANS AP &#8212;&#8212;, (1), a member of that ancient race, the Welsh, the lineal
descendants of that most ancient race, the Kelts, who inhabited western Europe
from time immemorial, lived in Wales, the territory reserved for this branch of
the Aryan family. He had a son:</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="SECOND_GENERATION" id="SECOND_GENERATION"></a>SECOND GENERATION</h2>


<p class="i3">&#8194;&#8194;2. STEPHENS AP EVANS, (2), who lived and died in Wales, and was the owner of
considerable estate. The liberal terms of Penn's grant in America attracted the
attention of his three sons:</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="THIRD_GENERATION" id="THIRD_GENERATION"></a>THIRD GENERATION</h2>


<p class="i3">&#8194;&#8194;3. JOSHUA AP STEPHENS AP EVANS, (3), the
immigrant ancestor of this family.</p>

<p class="i3">&#8194;&#8194;4. EBENEZER AP STEPHENS AP EVANS, (4).</p>

<p class="i3">&#8194;&#8194;5. DAVID AP STEPHENS AP EVANS, (5).</p>

<p>Who left their native home in Wales, and embarking in a sailing vessel, after
a voyage of something like thirty days, landed at Philadelphia; this sometime
prior to the year 1733. The three brothers selected lands in what is now Berkes
County, which was not set off from Philadelphia County until 1752. There are
traces of them in Union Township, where a David Stephens held land in 1728; he
was probably (5), (This from a letter I have from the secretary of the
Pennsylvania Historical Society). In 1752, a &quot;David Stephens, Jr.,&quot; died in
Britain Township, Bucks County, not far from Union, who had a brother Samuel,
and a &quot;Cousin John,&quot; (probably 7), which fits our history. (From documents in my
posession from Register of Wills, Philadelphia). His father, David Stephens,
Sr., was probably (5). Nothing would be more natural than that David Stephens,
(5), should have a son named for him, and that that son should seek lands over
in Bucks, and that the family name of John should descend, as it has through
many generations in our own lines, to his. David's brother Joshua had a son
John, (7). It was while the three brothers, Joshua, Ebenezer and David, were
living under the jurisdiction of Philadelphia County, that they received their
shares of the Welsh estate. Hence, searches for this should be confined to
records prior to 1752, the time Berkes was set off from Philadelphia.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="FOURTH_GENERATION" id="FOURTH_GENERATION"></a>FOURTH GENERATION</h2>


<p>JOSHUA STEPHENS, Sr., (3), the name now being changed, lived in what is now
Berkes County, and probably in Union Township, near the David Stephens above
mentioned. His children were:</p>

<p class="i3">&#8194;&#8194;6. JOSHUA, born in 1733, the immediate
ancester of the family, and with whom the certain history of the family
begins.</p>

<p class="i3">&#8194;&#8194;7. JOHN &#8194; &#8194; &#8194; &#8194; }</p>
<p class="i3">&#8194;&#8194;8. STEPHENS } Of these two brothers nothing is
further known than that from a family tradition they &quot;went
South&quot;, whatever that means: &quot;South&quot; being an indefinite term from a
standpoint in Berkes County. John was a tory during the Revolution.
The existence of Stephens depends upon the testimony of Joshua
Bowen Stephens of Hardin, Ohio, in a conversation with me there
in 1886. To these three brothers Dr. John Wesley Stephens of
State Line, Indiana, added a sister, in a letter to me, (182):</p>

<p class="i3">&#8194;&#8194;9. HETTY &quot;who married a rich man named
Humphrey, had liveried servants,&quot; etc. If so, they probably lived in
Philadelphia.</p>

<p>JOSHUA STEPHENS, Jr., (6), was the founder of that particular line of the
family of which we have any definite knowledge. His father was Joshua Stephens,
(3), the immigrant ancestor, who settled in what is now Berkes County,
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Berkes was then a &quot;howling wilderness&quot; full of Indians and wild beasts. It
was here in 1733, that Joshua Stephens, Jr., was born. Neighbors were like
Angel's visits, &quot;few and far between&quot;. In Amity Township on the east lived
Mordecai Lincoln, in A. D. 1725, the ancestor of the illustrious President. In
Exeter Township to the north-east lived George Boone, in A. D. 1717, the
ancestor of Daniel Boone, the celebrated pioneer of Kentucky. Our family
tradition is that the Stephens and the Boones were intermarried, and it is known
that the Boones and Lincolns formed such alliances. (See Century Magazine for
November, 1886). Joshua became an expert in the use of the rifle. His early life
was spent on his father's farm and in hunting, in which he became very
proficient and for which he acquired considerable notoriety. Schools were scarce
in those days and his literary education was probably poor. No writings of his
are known to be in existence to-day. To his out-door life must be attributed the
cause of his longevity, extending to a period of ninety years. He did not marry
until he was 38 years of age. In 1771 he married Priscilla Humphreys. The fact
that she was a member of the Seventh-day Baptist Church, who were then quite
numerous in Chester County to the South of Berkes, and that his son E. D.
Stephens was born in Chester, suggests that at an early date in his life Joshua
left Berkes and settled in Chester, which he did at any rate, and lived not far
from Valley Forge. At the outbreak of the Revolutionary War he identified
himself with the patriot cause, and, according to the statement of his son, E.
D. Stephens, was commissioned Captain of a Company of sharpshooters. During the
famine of the American army in the winter of 1777-8 at Valley Forge, he hauled
corn to relieve their distress. On one occasion he obtained a furlough to return
home during harvest. With a Quaker and his brother John he was in the orchard
gathering apples. The Quaker was up in the apple tree, picking fruit, and
improved the opportunity to expostulate with Joshua over the wickedness of war,
and arguing that Joshua should stay at home like his brother John, the tory. In
the midst of his argument the Quaker fell out of the tree, and striking the
ground violently, broke his neck, and was picked up dead. This was regarded as
an act of Divine Judgment in favor of the war, and probably went far toward
encouraging the despairing hearts of the patriots about them.</p>

<p>A few years after the war he moved with his family to a place &quot;near the Warm
Springs, Virginia,&quot; said E. D. Stephens. Whether this was the Warm Springs in
Bath County, is hard to determine. &quot;And then in a few years&quot; said the same
person, &quot;to near LEXINGTON, (Carlisle) Kentucky.&quot; These residences are
indefinitely located. &quot;The Warm Springs&quot; may have been in what is now KENAWHA
County, West Virginia for there are such there, and according to Mr. Jordan,
above quoted, they lived &quot;near a river, in the vicinity of the residence of
Daniel Boone,&quot; who lived in KENAWHA. (See Hale's &quot;Trans-Allegheny Pioneers&quot;). It
was while here, said Jordan, that Boone was a frequent visitor to the place of
Joshua, whom he invariably greeted as &quot;Cousin.&quot; Just what the relationship was
is unknown, but it undoubtedly existed. One evening Boone came to the Stephens'
place, weary, and said &quot;Twenty-one less.&quot; They understood from this laconic
remark, that he referred to the number of Indians he had killed that day.</p>

<p>Joshua was accompanied or followed to &quot;near Lexington&quot; by two of his
brothers-in-law, Joshua and Jonathan Humphreys. Here two of his sons left to
find homes for themselves&#8212;David Humphreys, (10), who settled in Evansville,
Indiana, and Silas, (14), who settled in Nashville, Tenn. Katie, (12), a
daughter died in Kentucky at a tender age.</p>

<p>It was while in Kentucky that he knocked a Dutchman down for insulting his
daughter Hannah, and dislocated his (Stephen's) thumb.</p>

<p>It must have been about 1798 when he decided to remove to near Chillicothe,
Ohio, for that year his son, E. D. Stephens was fourteen years old, and was
apprenticed to a tanner, which naturally was on his mother's death. This occured
while they were on the Pickaway Plains, in Ohio. As they were travelling, the
women of the party took off their shoes to walk on the cool grass on account of
the heat. His wife was bitten by a copper-head snake, and shortly died, her body
turning to the color of the snake.</p>

<p>JOSHUA STEPHENS, (6), was over six feet high, kept his face shaven smoothly,
had blue eyes and dark hair, and was powerful physically, and kept a straight
figure of his body until his death.&#8212;Statement of Joshua Stephens, (32).</p>

<p>JOSHUA STEPHENS, (6), a Revolutionary soldier and ancestor of the Stephens
family, was born in Union Township, Berkes County, Penn., in 1733. John
Stephens, (15), his son, father of Nancy Stephens Mitchell, was born in Chester
County, Penn., Dec. 23, 1781. Union Township is separated from Amity and from
Exeter Township by the Schuylkill River. In Exeter Township lived George Boone,
A. D. 1717, ancestor of Daniel Boone, who intermarried with the Stephens. And in
Amity Township lived Mordecai Lincoln, A. D. 1725, and probably also the
Stephens. At an early date in his life, Joshua Stephens left Berkes County and
settled in Chester County, not far from Valley Forge. His early life was spent
on his father's farm in hunting. He was an expert rifleman, and his proficiency
acquired for him considerable notoriety. In 1771, when he was thirty-eight years
of age, he married Priscilla Humphreys, who was a Seventh-day Baptist. At the
outbreak of the Revolutionary War Joshua Stephens, (6), identified himself with
the patriot cause, and was commissioned by General Washington as Captain of a
Company of Sharpshooters. During the famine of the American Army in the winter
of 1777-8 at Valley Forge, he hauled corn from his farm to relieve their
distress. On one occasion he was granted a furlough to return home during
harvest.</p>

<p>A few years after the war he moved with his family to a place near Warm
Springs, Virginia. After another few years to Lexington, Kentucky. While there,
Daniel Boone was a frequent visitor and greeted him as &quot;Cousin&quot;. About 1798, he
decided to remove to near Chillicothe, Ohio, lived in either Ross County or
Franklin County until about 1816, when he followed his two sons, John, (15), and
E. D., (16), to Shelby County, where he lived with them on their farm near
Hardin. His grand-children remember his old Revolutionary Army great coat and
his stories of Revolutionary times. His love for the chase never forsook him. He
attributes his longevity to his outdoor life. He was over six feet in height,
kept his face smoothly shaved, had blue eyes and dark hair; was powerful
physically and kept an erect figure till his death. He lived to be ninety years
of age. He died in March, in 1823, on the farm of his son John, (15), near
Hardin and was buried in the old Hardin graveyard.</p>

1816, when he followed his two sons, John, (15), and E. D., (16), to Shelby
County, where he lived with them on their farms near Hardin. His grand-children
remember how the old gentlemen used to sit around the fire-place while they
teased him by slyly pouring corn into the huge pockets of his old Revolutionary
Army coat. Although over eighty years of age, the love of the chase never died,
and he often took his old rifle and spectacles and sat by the old salt lick and
waited for the deer which never came. (So said Richard Cannon, of Hardin, to me
in 1886, who knew him well, and also spoke of his Revolutionary services). He
died in March, 1823, on the farm of his son John, (15), near Hardin, and was
buried in the old Hardin graveyard. The grave was identified to me in 1886, and
marked by me then with a wooden head board. His children were:</p>

<p>HANNAH STEPHENS, (13), daughter of Joshua Stephens, (6), is described as
having been a very &quot;beautiful woman&quot; and was widely courted on that account, her
father having been compelled to chastise a Dutchman, who became too familiar.
She was born in Penn., May 2, 1776; accompanied her parents to Virginia,
Kentucky and Ohio. She married Thomas McClish in Ross County about 1803. About
1816, or perhaps a little earlier, they moved to Shelby County, where he founded
the town of Hardin, Oct. 5, 1816, naming it for the famous Kentucky general,
(General Hardin was killed near there) which was the first County Seat. He
dedicated a square to the county on the condition that it should be used solely
for the Court House, which it never was, and is still unused. At an early date
they moved over in Putnam County, then a dence wilderness, and lived with no
neighbors nearer than 40 miles amid Indians and wild beasts. She died March 13,
1840. Her husband was born July 1, 1776, and died of a nasal hemmorrage Dec. 26,
1826. They were buried near Dupont, where their graves are yet to be seen. (I
have a page of their family record taken from their old family Bible). Their
children were:</p>

<p>SILAS STEPHENS, (14), son of Joshua Stephens, (6), left his father's home,
&quot;near Lexington, Kentucky,&quot; and settled near Nashville, Tenn., where he married
and acquired considerable property in land and slaves; these latter he freed
just before the war (about 1859), and one of them came to Shelby County, Ohio,
which is the only information ever had from Silas. He died sine prolos about
1865.</p>

<p>JOHN STEPHENS, (15), son of Joshua Stephens, (6), was born Dec. 23, 1781, in
Penn., accompanied his parents to Ross County, Ohio; voted for the adoption of
the first constitution of that state November 29, 1802, being just about of age;
enlisted in the U. S. Army for the war of 1812; was present at the surrender of
General Hull, Sunday, August 16, 1812; and witnessed the victory of Commodore
Perry, September 10, 1813, from the shores of Lake Erie. Rev. M. A. Jordon, his
step-son said that John entered the Army as an ensign, and rose to the rank of
Colonel, and after the war was high sheriff of Western Ohio. He was commissioned
Captain of the State Militia in 1822. (I have the original commission issued by
Governor E. A. Brown). About 1816, he moved to near St. Paris, Champaign County,
where he died on his farm September 12, 1873. He had been a lay preacher of the
Methodist Protestant Church. He was twice married, first to Nancy Brown, (about
1810), by whom he had nine children; he married secondly Mrs. &#8212;&#8212; Jordan, by whom
he had no children. Nancy Brown Stephens was born Feb. 4, 1787. His children
were:</p>

<p>EBENEZER DAVID STEPHENS, (16), son of Joshua Stephens, (6), was born in
Chester County, Penn., May 7, 1784; accompanied his parents to Kentucky, where,
in 1798, (probably on the death of his mother), he was apprenticed to a tanner
at &quot;Yellow Springs, Kentucky,&quot; but disliking his master, ran away, and followed
his father to Ross County, Ohio. He is said to have burned the brick for the
first house of that kind in Chillicothe, and refused to take a piece of land in
the proposed city of Columbus, in payment for a kiln of brick; he served six
weeks in the war of 1812; in 1816, he settled on the S. E. &#188; of section 18
Turtle Creek Township, Shelby County, where he farmed till his death, on
September 20, 1868. He married Jan. 11, 1811, Sarah Groome, daughter of Ezekiel

<p>The foregoing seventy-three pages include all the names and date of birth,
deaths and marriages of the descendents of Joshua Stephens, (6), which I have to
date. The subject matter is merely a skeleton of the mass of family history
data, which I have on hand, including biographies, pictures, manuscripts,
letters, papers, relics, etc. I have put it in this shape for the reasons:</p>

<p>1. That it is impossible just now to publish the family history in full as it
should be.</p>

<p>2. Fearing possibly a destruction of the data, etc., on hand, in this shape
it can at least be preserved, as one copy will be deposited in the archives of
the &quot;Historical Society of Southern California,&quot; at Los Angeles, California, and
one copy in the archives of the &quot;Ohio State Archaeological and Historical
Society&quot; at Columbus, Ohio; so that, if fortunately any relative should have a
sufficiency of that commendable family love and pride to perpetuate the record,
he will have a foundation on which to build, by going to those archives.</p>

<p>I am aware that this work must contain errors. Many letters are vague;
hand-writing hard to understand; correspondents are often contradictory, and
many of their statements are known by me to be erroneous. I have endeavored to
verify each report, and have, in many instances, successfully. I will reserve an
account of my very interesting experience in digging up family history for the
to be published work. There are undoubtedly clerical errors in this work, which
I have corrected with ink so far as detected.</p>

<p>THIS WORK OF GATHERING family was begun in April, 1881, and has been
continued by me unremittingly ever since, and will be so long as I live. Due
acknowledgements will be made in the to-be published work, of all assistance.</p>

<p>A church of Seventh-Day Baptists was established on French Creek, in the
Northern part of Chester County, Colony of Pennsylvania, in the year 1722. It
became extinct after 1812. The name of Stephens is on the list of
Members.&#8212;Letter of Charles H. Greene, of Alfred, N. Y., July 11, 1901.</p>

<p>JOSHUA HUMPHREYS was granted 400 acres near where the town of Carlisle now
stands, in Fayette County, Virginia, (near Kentucky in the year 1785) upon a
Land Office Treasury Warrant issued July 1, 1780, and survey made Feb. 26,
1873.&#8212;Letter of J. D. Hudgens, Clerk of the U. S. Office at Frankfort, Ky.</p>

<p>JOSHUA STEPHENS, (6), was over six feet high, kept his face shaven smoothly,
had blue eyes and dark hair, and was powerful physically, and kept a straight
figure of his body until his death,&#8212;Statement of Joshua Stephens, (32).</p>

<h2><a name="NOTE" id="NOTE"></a>NOTE.</h2>


<p>Desiring for myself a copy of the generalogy of the Stephens family I found
on investigating, that a number of printed copies could be secured at the cost
of one typewritten one, and after deciding to print I concluded to have a number
printed for distribution.</p>

<p>All who may receive one of these histories will appreciate the greatness of
the task accomplished by our esteemed relative, Bascom A. C. Stephens of
California, who searched out the historical facts and family traditions. The
family is fortunate to have one of its members able and willing to devote the
time and labor necessary to gather this information.</p>

<p>I am under obligation to W. G. Stephens of Chattanooga from whose book this
copy is taken.</p>

<p>I am taking some liberties in having a number of copies printed, knowing that
many members of the family would never have an opportunity to see and a much
less chance to own one of these histories unless someone would assume this
responsibility.</p>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
